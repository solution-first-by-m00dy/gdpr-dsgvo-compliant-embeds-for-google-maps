* GDPR-DSGVO compliant: Your Google Maps iframe embedding only loads after consenting via button click. Hence there are no requests made to Google's server beforehand.
* Iframe Input: Paste your Google Maps iframe code and see the shortcode for easy insertion.
* Consent Button: Define your own button text (e.g. Load Google Maps), choose rounded or square styling, and pick background and text colors.
* Design Modes: Select a light or dark overlay or go “custom” to set your own overlay background, button colors and privacy-text colors via the WordPress color picker.
* Size Control: Specify map width and height in % or px (e.g. 100% or 600px).
* Privacy Notice: Toggle a GDPR-DSGVO notice, enter custom info text and link text, and point it to your privacy-policy URL.
* Unlimited Maps: Free tier by default lets you add unlimited embeds. Have fun!
